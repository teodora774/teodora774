- 👋 Hi, I’m @teodora774
- 👀 I’m interested in computational chemistry as a career.
- 🌱 I am in the third year of my chemistry degree and I am learning python as I hope to specialise in computational chemistry. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small beginner level projects, not necesarily chemistry related. 
- 📫 How to reach me: email address: teodorarosu2005@yahoo.com
